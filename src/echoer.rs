/// When a worker is started on a node, it is given one or more addresses. The node
/// maintains a mailbox for each address and whenever a message arrives for a specific
/// address it delivers that message to the corresponding registered worker.
///
/// Workers can handle messages from other workers running on the same or a different
/// node. In response to a message, an worker can: make local decisions, change its
/// internal state, create more workers, or send more messages to other workers running on
/// the same or a different node.
